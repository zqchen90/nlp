# Evaluate results

I get 105 positive cases and 106 negative cases in `./data/gaokao_char_uniq_filter.txt`.

Note that negative cases are generated by randomly choosing another character.

Please run `run_test.py` to evaluate similarity results on these cases. And here are some using different simi_type in `FontSimi`:

| Font Simi Type | Optimal Simi Threshold | Recall | Precision | F1 |
| :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: | 
| overlap | 0.65  | 0.848 | 0.795 | 0.820  | 
| jaccard | 0.50  | 0.924 | 0.890 | 0.907 | 
| mindistance | 0.65  | 0.771 | 0.900 | 0.831 | 
| overlap+jaccard | 0.60  | 0.810 | 0.955 | 0.876 | 
| min distance+jaccard  | 0.55  | 0.829 | 0.870 | 0.849 | 
| overlap+min distance  | 0.65  | 0.829 | 0.906 | 0.866 | 
| overlap+jaccard+min distance  | 0.60  | 0.819  | 0.925  | 0.869 | 

To get high precision and well f1, recommend settings are:
 - Font simi type = overlap+jaccard
 - simi threshold = 0.60
